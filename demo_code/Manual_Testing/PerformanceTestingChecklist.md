# âœ… Checklists for Different Stages of Performance Testing

This document contains checklists to help structure and manage performance testing processes effectively, from preparation to automation.

---

##  Pre-Load Testing Checklist

-  **Testing goals are defined** (e.g., maximum load capacity, SLA targets).
-  **Realistic user scenarios are prepared and documented.**
-  **Metrics for collection are selected** (Requests Per Second, latency, throughput, error rate).
-  **Test data is prepared**, including valid and boundary cases.
-  **Test environment is defined** to closely resemble production.
-  **Test schedule is agreed upon** with the team and system administrators.
-  **Load testing tools are selected** and validated.
-  **Monitoring of system and application resources is configured.**
-  **Baseline performance metrics are collected** for future comparison.

##  Load Testing Execution Checklist

-  **Tests are initiated with gradual load increase (ramp-up).**
-  **Stability of the load is monitored** at every stage.
-  **Performance and error metrics are continuously collected.**
-  **System behavior under peak load is closely observed.**
-  **All services are checked** to ensure they operate correctly and do not crash.
-  **Delays and errors are logged** with timestamps and context.
-  **Different types of load tests are executed**:  
  - Load Testing  
  - Stress Testing  
  - Spike Testing
  - Soak tests (long-duration)** are conducted to assess long-term stability.

##  Results Analysis Checklist

-  **Key performance metrics are analyzed**: latency, RPS, throughput, errors.
-  **Bottlenecks and possible root causes are identified.**
-  **Results are compared with baseline metrics.**
-  **Threshold values for SLA/SLO are defined.**
-  **Logs and monitoring data are reviewed** for additional context.
-  **Recommendations are formulated** for system performance improvement.
-  **A final report is prepared**, including visual charts and clear conclusions.

##  Load Testing Automation Checklist

-  **Load test scenarios are implemented for CLI execution.**
-  **CI/CD integration is configured** (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI).
-  **Success criteria are defined** (thresholds, pass/fail conditions).
-  **Automated collection and storage of test reports is implemented.**
-  **Alerts are set up** for performance threshold violations.
-  **Test environment stability is validated** prior to automation.
-  **Tests are run regularly**, based on schedule or triggered by specific events.
